# Discourage Linux from swapping idle processes to disk (default = 60).
# This control is used to define how aggressively the kernel swaps out anonymous memory relative to pagecache and other caches.
# Increasing the value increases the amount of swapping. 
vm.swappiness = 10

# vfs_cache_pressure this variable controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for caching of VFS caches, versus pagecache and swap. 
# Increasing this value increases the rate at which VFS caches are reclaimed.
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50

# Asynchronous non-blocking I/O (AIO) is a feature that allows a process to initiate multiple I/O operations simultaneously without having to wait for any of them to complete.
# This helps boost performance for applications that are able to overlap processing and I/O.
# Increasing this value increases the random IO performance.

# Disable unprivileged user namespaces. Unprivileged user namespaces can make severe vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel much more easily exploitable.

# Disable core dumps in Linux. Core dumps are created for diagnosing and debugging errors in Linux applications. They are also known as memory dump, crash dump, system dump, or ABEND dump.
# However, core dumps may contain sensitive info, such as passwords and user data, such as PAN, SSN, or encryption keys. Also, they take up a large amount of disk space too.

# Protecting Hard and Symbolic Links. To prevent malicious users from exploiting potential vulnerabilities caused by unprotected hard and symbolic links, we include a feature that only allows links to be created or followed provided certain conditions are met. 
#
# In case of hard links, one of the following needs to be true:
# - The user owns the file to which they link.
# - The user already has read and write access to the file to which they link. 
#
# In case of symbolic links, processes are only permitted to follow links when outside of world-writeable directories with sticky bits, or one of the following needs to be true:
# - The process following the symbolic link is the owner of the symbolic link.
# - The owner of the directory is the same as the owner of the symbolic link.
