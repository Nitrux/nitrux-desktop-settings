# Discourage Linux from swapping idle processes to disk (default = 60).
# This control is used to define how aggressively the kernel swaps out anonymous memory relative to pagecache and other caches.
# Increasing the value increases the amount of swapping. 
vm.swappiness = 10

# vfs_cache_pressure this variable controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for caching of VFS caches, versus pagecache and swap. 
# Increasing this value increases the rate at which VFS caches are reclaimed.
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50

# Asynchronous non-blocking I/O (AIO) feature that allows a process to initiate multiple I/O operations simultaneously without having to wait for any of them to complete.
# This helps boost performance for applications that are able to overlap processing and I/O.
# Increasing this value increases the random IO performance.
